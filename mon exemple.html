			<h1>A Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams on Avian Carriers</h1>

			<section>
				<h1>Status of this Memo</h1>
				<p>
				This memo describes an experimental method for the encapsulation of
				IP datagrams in avian carriers.  This specification is primarily
			   useful in Metropolitan Area Networks.  This is an experimental, not
			   recommended standard.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

				<h1>Overview and Rational</h1>
				<p>
				Avian carriers can provide high delay, low throughput, and low
			   altitude service.  The connection topology is limited to a single
			   point-to-point path for each carrier, used with standard carriers,
			   but many carriers can be used without significant interference with
			   each other, outside of early spring.  This is because of the 3D ether
			   space available to the carriers, in contrast to the 1D ether used by
			   IEEE802.3.  The carriers have an intrinsic collision avoidance
			   system, which increases availability.  Unlike some network
			   technologies, such as packet radio, communication is not limited to
			   line-of-sight distance.  Connection oriented service is available in
			   some cities, usually based upon a central hub topology.
